# Team Profile Generator

## Description

A Node.js command-line application built to take in information about the manager and employees, which then is used to generate a HTML file with cards of said employees. This app also contains tests from Jest, which were used to pass constructor tests.

## User Story

As a manager a user want to generate a webpage that displays my team's basic info so that a user have quick access to their emails and GitHub profiles.

## Instructions

Install the app by cloning the repo and its dependencies, then start by typing in "node index.js" into the terminal. If you made a mistake, then re-run the app, it will overwrite the HTML file, so there is no need to delete it manually each time.

HTML file will be saved in the same directory as index.js file.

## Demo Screenshot and Video
